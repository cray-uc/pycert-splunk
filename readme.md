# API Data Retrieval and Splunk Integration

This Python script is designed to retrieve data from an API in JSON format, filter the data based on a specific condition (entries within the last 30 days), and send the filtered data to Splunk using the HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- `requests` library installed (you can install it using `pip install requests`)

## Configuration

1. Open the script in a text editor.
2. Replace `"[url_here]"` with the actual URL of the API you want to query.
3. Replace `"YOUR_SPLUNK_TOKEN"` with your Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token.
4. Update `"https://your-splunk-instance.com:8088/services/collector/event"` with the correct URL for your Splunk HEC endpoint.

## Usage

1. Save the script with a `.py` extension (e.g., `api_data_retrieval.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:

```
python api_data_retrieval.py
```

The script will perform the following actions:

1. Query the specified API and retrieve the data in JSON format.
2. Filter the data to include only entries within the last 30 days.
3. Create a list of dictionaries containing the common name and entry timestamp for the filtered entries.
4. Write the filtered data to a JSON file named `domain_check_results.json` in the same directory.
5. Send the filtered data to Splunk using the HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors while running the script, check the following:

- Ensure that you have replaced the placeholders (`"[url_here]"`, `"YOUR_SPLUNK_TOKEN"`, and `"https://your-splunk-instance.com:8088/services/collector/event"`) with the correct values.
- Verify that the API URL is accessible and returns valid JSON data.
- Check that your Splunk HEC endpoint URL and token are correct, and that you have the necessary permissions to send data to Splunk.
- If you receive an error message related to the `requests` library, make sure it is installed correctly by running `pip install requests`.

## Dependencies

This script relies on the following Python libraries:

- `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests.
- `json`: A built-in Python library for working with JSON data.
- `datetime`: A built-in Python library for working with dates and times.
